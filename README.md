In the era that everything changes so fast, I proabably will define my identity as a technologist who likes building things. Hopefully this statement does not age too bad.


Things I think are worth spending time building for the most:
* Something that makes us healthier
* Something that makes us suffer less
* Something that makes us learn better
* Something that keeps us talking to each other while we all remain very, very different humans
